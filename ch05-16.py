prompt = "The first programming language to be invented was Plankalk√ºl, which was \
designed by Konrad Zuse in the 1940s, but not publicly known until 1972 (and not imple\

anguage was Fortran, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of IBM researchers led \
by John Backus. The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scie\
