anguage was Fortran, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of IBM researchers led \
by John Backus. The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scie\
ntists to develop a universal computer language; the result of their effort was AL\
GOL 58. Separately, John McCarthy of MIT developed Lisp, the first language with o\
